# F# Tutorial

Collection of examples for F# with Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio Code.

## Getting started
Visual Studio 2019 is the first choice: you have a nice integrated environment for coding and testing. You can download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) from its site.

Visual Studio Code is a good alternative and multiplatform: it is running on Windows, Mac and Linux. If you want to code with Visual Studio Code, add [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) and start to create application with F#.

## Building application
Building F# Applications starts by showing how to use the functional features of F# to rapidly turn requirements into software designs that are correct, complete, extensible, bug-free, and easy to read and understand. We will start by setting up our F# development environment and reviewing some key language features. 

We'll then look in depth at two powerful techniques for building real-world F# applications: type-first design and function composition. We'll then learn to leverage advanced F# tools to build and test applications.The video course examines key language features and functional programming techniques with the goal of providing a good understanding of the basic building blocks that can be used to build higher abstractions and more comprehensive solutions. 

As we go, we will learn how to set up a development environment and design a build process with tools that leverage the F# language.

## Data programming
Data Programming with F# presents practical techniques for handling real-world data programming challenges. We'll first see how to build efficient, extensible engines to parse and process documents and data streams. 

Then we'll study how to process large sets of data with maximal performance and efficiency using asynchronous workflows, agents, and .NET reactive extensions. Next, we'll learn to use type providers, a unique F# feature that lets us program with data as if it were code. You will be capable of writing solutions with less code, fewer bugs, and better alignment with business requirements.
